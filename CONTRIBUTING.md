# Development requirements
This project uses `pre-commit` alongside a couple of linters to ensure everything is more or less following the best practices and as such maintain a minimum level of quality.

## linters
- hadolint
- shellcheck

## pre-commit installation
If you have `pipx` you can just install it with `pipx install pre-commit` and you are good to go

Alternatively please refer to your OSs package manager or follow https://pre-commit.com/#installation
